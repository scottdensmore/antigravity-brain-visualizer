# agent-ingest

A small Go command that scans a machine for local agent transcripts — Antigravity,
OpenAI Codex, and Claude Code — and pushes them to a running
[Agent Brain Visualizer](../README.md), so trajectories captured on any machine are
visible from any other machine pointed at the same store.

The visualizer is the only thing that talks to the database; this CLI is just an
HTTP client for its `/api/ingest` endpoints. It stays deliberately thin — it locates
files, reads them, and uploads them verbatim. **The server parses them**, so the CLI
never has to understand any tool's transcript format.

When a source keeps its own AI analysis on disk (Antigravity's per-session
`summary.json`), the CLI uploads it so a summary computed on one machine reaches the
shared store without a recompute. A summary rides along with its transcript when the
transcript is pushed; a summary that appears **after** its transcript was already ingested
(a common case, since it's written when the session ends) is synced on its own. The CLI
diffs local summaries against a separate summary manifest and sends only the ones the store
is missing or that changed — without re-uploading the transcript — so a post-hoc summary
still lands.

## Install

Download the binary for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/scottdensmore/antigravity-brain-visualizer/releases/latest) —
assets are named `agent-ingest-<os>-<arch>` (`linux`/`macos`/`windows`, `amd64`/`arm64`):

```bash
# Linux/macOS — pick your platform, e.g. macos-arm64 for Apple silicon:
curl -sSL -o agent-ingest \
  https://github.com/scottdensmore/antigravity-brain-visualizer/releases/latest/download/agent-ingest-macos-arm64
chmod +x agent-ingest
./agent-ingest --version
```

Or build from source (Go 1.23+). Stamp the version so `--version` reports which build you're running:

```bash
cd cli
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git describe --tags --always)" -o agent-ingest .
```

(A plain `go build -o agent-ingest .` works too; it just reports `dev` as the version.)

## Use

```bash
# Push everything this machine has to a local visualizer:
agent-ingest

# A remote visualizer, only Claude Code sessions:
agent-ingest --server https://viz.example.com --source claude-code

# See what would happen, without uploading (still queries the manifest):
agent-ingest --dry-run
```

Running it again uploads nothing: each session is keyed by a stable `(source, id)`
and skipped when the server already has identical content, so it is safe to run on a
schedule (`cron`, a `launchd` timer, …).

Repeat runs are also cheap locally: the CLI keeps a small scan cache (see
`AGENT_INGEST_CACHE` below) mapping each session to the size, mtime, and content hash
seen on the previous run, so unchanged transcripts are not re-read and re-hashed — only
stat'ed. The cache is purely an optimization: it never affects what the server receives
(the server-side manifest diff is always consulted), and a missing, corrupt, or
unwritable cache just falls back to full hashing. `--no-cache` forces that full re-hash.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `--server URL` | `http://localhost:8080` (or `$AGENT_INGEST_SERVER`) | Base URL of the visualizer. |
| `--source NAME` | all | Source to sync; repeatable. One of `antigravity-cli`, `antigravity-ide`, `codex`, `claude-code`. |
| `--home DIR` | current user's home | Home directory to scan (mainly for testing). |
| `--batch-size N` | `100` | Sessions per push request. |
| `--no-cache` | off | Ignore the local scan cache and re-read and re-hash every transcript. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Report what would be pushed, without pushing. |
| `--json` | off | Write a machine-readable summary to stdout. |
| `--quiet` | off | Suppress progress on stderr. |
| `--version` | | Print the version and exit. |
| `-h`, `--help` | | Show help and exit. |

### Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| `AGENT_INGEST_SERVER` | Default for `--server`. |
| `AGENT_INGEST_CACHE` | Path of the scan cache file (default: `agent-ingest/scan-cache.json` under the OS user cache directory, e.g. `~/.cache/agent-ingest/scan-cache.json` on Linux). |
| `AGENT_INGEST_TOKEN` | Bearer token, sent when the server sets `INGEST_TOKEN`. Passed via the environment (not a flag) so it never lands in shell history or the process list. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | Success — everything was ingested or already up to date. |
| `1` | The sync ran but something failed (server error, a rejected session). |
| `2` | The command was invoked incorrectly. |

The human summary and `--json` go to **stdout**; progress and errors go to **stderr**,
so the tool composes cleanly in scripts and pipelines. The `--json` object carries an
`ok` boolean (false when any source failed) alongside per-source counts and an `error`
message for any source that could not be synced, so a script can detect failure without
parsing the exit code.

## Scheduling

Because a re-run uploads only what changed and exits `0` when there's nothing to do,
`agent-ingest` is meant to run unattended on a timer. A few things make it well-behaved in a
scheduler:

- The final summary always prints to **stdout** — redirect it to a log file (as below) or to
  `/dev/null`. The per-source progress chatter is silenced automatically whenever output isn't
  a terminal (i.e. under any scheduler), so `--quiet` is optional; it just forces the same on a
  terminal.
- Errors go to **stderr** and set a non-zero **exit code** — wire those to your alerting.
- Keep `AGENT_INGEST_TOKEN` out of the job definition where you can (an env file with tight
  permissions), since it grants write access to the store.

**cron** (Linux/macOS) — every 30 minutes, token sourced from a private file, output logged.
A crontab entry is a single line (cron has no `\` continuation), and because the file is
_sourced_ it must `export` the token so the child process inherits it — so `token.env` here
holds `export AGENT_INGEST_TOKEN=...`:

```cron
*/30 * * * * . "$HOME/.config/agent-ingest/token.env" && /usr/local/bin/agent-ingest --server https://viz.example.com >> "$HOME/.local/state/agent-ingest.log" 2>&1
```

**systemd timer** (Linux) — a `oneshot` service plus a timer, as user units:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/agent-ingest.service
[Unit]
Description=Push local agent transcripts to the Agent Brain Visualizer

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Environment=AGENT_INGEST_SERVER=https://viz.example.com
# EnvironmentFile wants a bare KEY=VALUE line (no "export"): AGENT_INGEST_TOKEN=...
# (so it's NOT the same file as the cron token.env above, which is sourced and exports).
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/agent-ingest/token.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/agent-ingest
```

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/agent-ingest.timer
[Unit]
Description=Sync agent transcripts every 30 minutes

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5min
OnUnitActiveSec=30min
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now agent-ingest.timer
# For runs while you're logged out: sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

A failed sync marks the service failed (`systemctl --user status agent-ingest`), which your
usual unit monitoring can pick up.

**launchd** (macOS) — a LaunchAgent that runs every 30 minutes:

```xml
<!-- ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.agent-ingest.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>com.example.agent-ingest</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/bin/agent-ingest</string>
  </array>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
  <dict>
    <key>AGENT_INGEST_SERVER</key><string>https://viz.example.com</string>
    <key>AGENT_INGEST_TOKEN</key><string>REPLACE_ME</string>
  </dict>
  <key>StartInterval</key><integer>1800</integer>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/tmp/agent-ingest.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.agent-ingest.plist
# (older macOS: launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.agent-ingest.plist)
```

launchd has no env file, so the token lives in the plist — keep it readable only by you
(`chmod 600`; note its value is still visible to anything running as you, e.g. via
`launchctl print`).

## Test

```bash
cd cli
go test ./...
```

The tests are hermetic: they scan a temporary home and push to an in-process HTTP
stub, so no real agent files or running server are needed.
